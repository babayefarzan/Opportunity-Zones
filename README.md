# Opportunity-Zones

Scripts for generating SEEDS II Solar Opportunity Zones layers for [Solar For All app](https://maps.nrel.gov/solar-for-all/).

* _What are Solar Opportunity Zones?_   
    * Designed to spur economic development by providing tax benefits to investors, Qualified Opportunity Zones are economically-distressed communities where new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. Localities qualify as Opportunity Zones if they have been nominated for that designation by the state and that nomination has been certified by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury via the Internal Revenue Service. Solar Opportunity Zones estimate the potential for solar technology investments in these zones.  

### Layer set 1: Technical potential for roof-mount PV
Using data generated by Sigrin and Mooney (2018), combine and aggregate data for all income levels within Qualified Opportunity Zone Census tracts. Visualize by generation and capacity while retaining relevant fields. 

### Layer set 2: Technical potential for ground-mount PV
Using input layers for the _Renewable Energy Potential (reV) Model_ (publication upcoming), (1) identify developable areas for ground-mount PV, (2) summarize potential generation and capcity for developable areas within Qualified Opportunity Zones. 

*Metadata for both sets of layers are included as documentation for downloadable layers in Carto portal.*
